synopsis: A formalization of the Dedekind real numbers in Coq

description: |-
  A formalization of Dedekind reals numbers that started as a
  student project at the University of Ljubljana under the supervision
  of Andrej Bauer, and was brought to the present state by Vincent Semeria.

  At this point the formalization of the field of reals is finished.
  There are still several unfinished theorems concering the lattice-theoretic
  structure of the reals (search for `todo` in the Coq files). We would be
  delighted by contributions that would bring the formalization
  closer to completion.

  ## Structure of the modules
  
  - `MiscLemmas`: various lemmas about rational numbers
  - `Cut`: definition of Dedekind cuts and several other basic notions
  - `Additive`: Additive structure of the reals
  - `Multiplication` : Multiplicative structure of the relas
